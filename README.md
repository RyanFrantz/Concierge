# Concierge
## Purpose
Concierge is my attempt to build an easy to use RESTful web application to act as the smart glue between my monitoring stuff (Nagios, Splunk, logstash, db tools, etc) and a simple status dashboard that non-technical users can understand.

## Deployment
Current Concierge runs as a standalone script.  My plan is to use Apache to properly deply the code in the future.  This is __very__ **ALPHA** at the moment.
